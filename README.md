This repository contains the code and resources for my personal project on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that performs image classification to distinguish between dogs and cats. I have trained the model on a large dataset of labeled dog and cat images, achieving high accuracy in predicting the class labels of new images.

Dataset
The dataset I used for training and evaluation is a collection of dog and cat images from kaggle. I organized the dataset into two parts: a training set and a test set. The training set was used to train the CNN model, while the test set was used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Model Training
Throughout the project, I experimented with various CNN architectures and hyperparameter settings to optimize the model's performance. After careful consideration and training, I achieved an impressive accuracy rate on the test set.

The model was trained using Python, PyTorch, NumPy, and Matplotlib. To reproduce the results and run the code.

After several iterations of training and fine-tuning, my CNN model achieved an accuracy rate of 76.2% on the test set. This  accuracy is a testament to the effectiveness of the model in correctly classifying dog and cat images.

Contributions to this project are welcome.
